percolation.java

this algorithm is finding threshold probability that can percolate a system.

Assume a grid table of NxN, each grid can be open or close. If two grids are adjecent and both open, they are connected.

1. Each gird has same probability p to be open, (1-p) to be closed.
2. A system percolates if any grid on the bottom is connected to any of the grid on the top.
3. We want to know the p that can make the system percolate almost surely


Process:
1. Let all the grids be closed at the beginning
2. With each time, randomly choose a grid to be open
3. Check whether the system percolates; if yes, calculate the propotion of open grids;
 if not, continuly choose another grid to be open
