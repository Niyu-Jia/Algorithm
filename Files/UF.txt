UF.java 

this is an algorithm finding the connectivity using tree-based model.


Methods:

union(a,b) : connect a and b
find(a) : find the root of a

if a and b have same root, they are connected.

Notes: 
1. all the nodes in one tree are all connected to each other
2. when doing union, we add small tree to the larger tree to make structure flat
3. every time we got parent which is not root, change its parent directly to root value
